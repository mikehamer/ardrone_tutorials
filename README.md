Up and flying with the AR.Drone and ROS
========================================================

This repository contains the source-code for the Up and flying with the AR.Drone and ROS tutorial series, published on [Robohub](http://www.robohub.org).

A stable branch is maintained for each of the released tutorials, with the master branch always synchronized with the stable branch of the latest tutorial. Each tutorial's branch also contains all source-code required for the previous tutorials.

The following tutorials are planned for the series:

1. Install the required software and use a keyboard-controller to control the drone from a computer ([tutorial](http://robohub.org/up-and-flying-with-the-ar-drone-and-ros-getting-started), [branch](https://github.com/mikehamer/ardrone_tutorials/tree/getting-started))
2. Modify the keyboard controller to work with a joystick or control pad, giving much finer control ([tutorial](http://robohub.org/up-and-flying-with-the-ar-drone-and-ros-joystick-control), [branch](https://github.com/mikehamer/ardrone_tutorials/tree/joystick-control))
3. Look more closely at the data sent back from the drone and play with the on-board tag detection (coming very soon)
4. Write a controller that allows the drone to maintain a specified distance from a tag
5. Write a controller that allows us to control drone velocity, rather than body angle

Virtual Machine
---------------

These tutorials are (optionally) supported by the custom [ARDroneUbuntu virtual machine](http://bit.ly/VqtDql). This includes all software and source-code required to run this tutorial. Refer to the first tutorial on how to use the virtual machine.
