# A basic video display window for the tutorial "Up and flying with the AR.Drone and ROS | Getting Started"
# https://github.com/mikehamer/ardrone_tutorials_getting_started

# This display window listens to the drone's video feeds and updates the display at regular intervals
# It also tracks the drone's status and any connection problems, displaying them in the window's status bar
# By default it includes no control functionality. The class can be extended to implement key or mouse listeners if required

# Import the ROS libraries, and load the manifest file which through <depend package=... /> will give us access to the project dependencies
import roslib; roslib.load_manifest('ardrone_tutorials')
import rospy

# Import the two types of messages we're interested in
from sensor_msgs.msg import Image    	 # for receiving the video feed
from ardrone_autonomy.msg import Navdata # for receiving navdata feedback

# We need to use resource locking to handle synchronization between GUI thread and ROS topic callbacks
